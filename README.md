## Overview

The `convert_audio_to_text()` function provided within this project allows users to capture spoken words through a microphone and transcribe them into textual form using Google's Speech Recognition service. This project also incorporates error handling to manage recognition failures or encountered errors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-to-text-converter.git
    ```

2. Install the required Python library:

    ```bash
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    ```

## Usage

### Code Structure

The `convert_audio_to_text()` function comprises:

1. Initialization of the recognizer and capturing audio from the microphone.
2. Attempt to convert captured audio to text via Google's Speech Recognition service.
3. Handling potential recognition or request errors.

### Example

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Function to convert audio to text
def convert_audio_to_text():
    # ... (existing code)

# Call the function to convert audio to text
audio_text = convert_audio_to_text()
if audio_text:
    print("You said:", audio_text)  # Display the converted text

# Additional text manipulation
if audio_text:
    lowercase_text = audio_text.lower()  # Convert text to lowercase
    words = lowercase_text.split()  # Split text into words
    # Perform additional operations as required
```
